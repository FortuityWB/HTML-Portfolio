  Hey there, <br><br>
 At Blinkist, our mission is to help you keep learning new, exciting things. But we understand that these days it can be challenging to find time for this. <br><br> That’s why we’ve created a Blinkist service available to customers only: The Blinkist Minute – short insights and tips from the world’s best nonfiction books. One minute a day is all it takes to be a lifelong learner, and a dive into the blinks is just a click away. <br><br>Let’s start with a simple yet powerful productivity technique that will help put you in high gear today.<br><br><b>Instant productivity: The Pomodoro Technique</b><br><br> 

Do you struggle with procrastination? Have trouble maintaining focus? Check your emails every five minutes? The Pomodoro Technique might just be right for you!<br><br> 

This simple productivity method works by dicing up your workday into 25-minute chunks of totally focused work called pomodoros, separated by five-minute breaks.<br><br>

 If you’re curious about the name, “pomodoro” is Italian for “tomato” and the Italian founder of the technique used the popular tomato-shaped kitchen timer to time his work! <br><br>

 The idea is that, while you may struggle to focus for long periods, a measly 25 minutes is almost always doable, and the mandatory five-minute breaks ensure you’re refreshed enough to tackle the next pomodoro. 
The end result is that you get much more done during your workday.<br><br>

  So what are you waiting for? Pick a task, set a  <span style="color:#2ce080;">timer</span> for 25 minutes and give it a go!<br><br>

How do you deal with interruptions at work? 
  That’s another question answered by <b><i>The Pomodoro Technique</i> by Francesco Cirillo.</b><br><br>
